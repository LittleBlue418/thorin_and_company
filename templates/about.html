    <p>The formation of the group grew out of a meeting Gandalf had with
        Thorin in Bree which kindled Thorin's interest in recapturing his
        long lost family inheritance. (Thorin's grandfather had been the
        king of the Lonely Mountain when Smaug came and took it.)
        Remembering that he had once known an adventurous Hobbit on his
        travels in the Shire, Gandalf decided to add Bilbo to their
        company because he knew that stealth and cunning were preferable
        to force. Gandalf also believed that someone like Bilbo could
        keep the sometimes prideful and stubborn Dwarves from rash
        action. The superstitious Dwarves also considered thirteen to
        be an unlucky number, and as Gandalf had planned to leave on
        other business, welcomed a fourteenth to fill into their party.</p>

        <h3>Thorin Oakenshield</h3>
        <p>
            Thorin II, also called the Oakenshield, King under the
            Mountain or the Mountain King,[1] was the son of Thráin
            II, the older brother of Frerin and Dís, the grandson of
            King Thrór and the uncle of Fíli and Kíli. Thorin was
            best known for his deeds as leader of a company that
            infiltrated the lost Kingdom under the Mountain to take
            it back from Smaug and for leading an alliance of Men,
            Dwarves, and Elves in the Battle of the Five Armies.

        <h3>Bilbo Baggins</h3>
        <p>
            Bilbo Baggins was a Hobbit of the Shire, the main protagonist
            of The Hobbit and a secondary character in The Lord of the Rings.
            Gandalf suggested Bilbo Baggins to be hired by Thorin and
            Company to be their burglar in the Quest of Erebor, and later
            fought in the Battle of the Five Armies. Bilbo was also one
            of the bearers of the One Ring, and the first to voluntarily
            give it up, although with some difficulty. He wrote many of
            his adventures in a book he called There and Back Again. Bilbo
            adopted his second-cousin-once-removed Frodo Baggins to be his
            heir after his parents, Drogo Baggins and Primula Brandybuck,
            drowned in the Brandywine River.
            Bilbo was the first Hobbit to become famous in the world at
            large and was one of the few to visit The Undying Lands across
            the ocean.
